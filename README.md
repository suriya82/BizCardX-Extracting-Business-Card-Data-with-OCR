# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

Approach:
1. Install the required packages: We will need to install Python, Streamlit,
easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.
2. Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using
Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
card image and extracting its information.   We can use widgets like file
uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.
3. Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the
relevant information from the uploaded business card image. We can use
image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.
4. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,
display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. You can use
widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.
5. Implement database integration: Use a database management system like
SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
business card image. You can use SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to
delete the data through the streamlit UI
6. Test the application: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
expected. We can run the application on your local machine by running the
command streamlit run Application.py in the terminal, where Application.py is the name of
our Streamlit application file.
